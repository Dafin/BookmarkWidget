# BookmarkWidget :bookmark_tabs: 

### What is this?

This is ~~the greatest thing since sliced bread~~ a rudimentary web widget (being) built in Javascript.

The eventual goal of this app is to have it where users can log a collection of web addresses into this app and have it persist between browser sessions. Additional features will be added as time permits.

### Installation


You may choose to download and clone this repo [here](https://github.com/Dafin/BookmarkWidget), or, If those web addresses just can't wait, you may wish to navigate to the [live](https://dafin.github.io/BookmarkWidget) version.

##### Dependencies
Jquery version `>= 3.2`, a version is included, however it is recommended that you link to the latest CDN hosted version found [here](https://code.jquery.com). If this breaks anything, kindly submit an [issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).  

### How to use

	* Type in the address of the website you wish to save  ***Or...***
